History During the mid-1980s <comma> Gulf Air began to cut back its services to Dubai as it was concerned it was providing regional feeder flights for other carriers <stop>
 As a result <comma> Emirates was conceived in March 1985 with backing from Dubai's royal family <comma> and was required to operate independent of government subsidies <comma> apart from US$10 million in start-up capital <stop>
In the mid-1980s <comma> Pakistan International Airlines played a large role in establishing the Emirates airline by providing technical and administrative assistance to the new carrier as well as leaseing a new Boeing 737–300 and an Airbus A300B4-200 <stop>
The Royal Family's Dubai Royal Air Wing also provided the airline with two used Boeing 727–200 Adv <stop>
The airline's first flight <comma> flight EK600 <comma> was Dubai–Karachi on 25 October 1985 <stop>
Maurice Flanagan <comma> who previously worked at British Airways <comma> Gulf Air <comma> and BOAC and at the time was overseeing Dnata <comma> was appointed chief executive officer of the new airline <stop>
To acknowledge his services for aviation <comma> in 2000 <comma> Flanagan was made CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honour List <comma> and later honoured with knighthood <stop>
He would be joined at the airline by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum (as chairman) and now-Emirates president Tim Clark <stop>
Current chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum has since inherited the role of CEO <stop>
During its first year <comma> it carried about 260,000 passengers and 10,000 tons of freight <stop>
To highlight the airline's early success <comma> Gulf Air <comma> during Emirates' first year of operations <comma> suffered a 56% drop in profits <comma> and a loss the following year <stop>
<stop>
By 1986 <comma> the airline had added new destinations such as Colombo <comma> Dhaka <comma> Amman and Cairo to its route network <stop>
 In 1987 a second Boeing 727 was purchased from the Dubai Government and an A300 was temporarily replaced by a second example from Kuwait Airlines <stop>
On 3 July <comma> Emirates received its first bought aircraft <comma> an Airbus A310 (registration A6-EKA),[19] and with two examples <comma> launched daily non-stop services to London Gatwick on 6 July 1987 <stop>
The airline in 1987 added Frankfurt via Istanbul <comma> and Malé (Maldive) <stop>
 By the end of 1987 <comma> Emirates was serving 11 destinations <stop>
[citation needed] This was followed by an expansion into the Far East market in 1985 <comma> with flights to Bangkok <comma> Manila and Singapore,[19] and Hong Kong in 1991 <stop>
 During the first decade of operations <comma> Emirates recorded strong growths averaging 30% <stop>
 <stop>
Incorporation and growth: 1993–1999 <stop>
By the early 1990s <comma> Emirates was among the world's fastest growing airlines; revenue increased approximately US$100 million each year <comma> approaching US$500 million in the year 1993 <stop>
The airline carried 1 <stop>
6 million passengers and 68,000 tons of cargo and in the same year <comma> respectively <stop>
 <stop>
Emirates is the world's largest operator of the Boeing 777 and the only airline to have operated every version of the aircraft <stop>
<stop>
With the onset of the Gulf War <comma> business increased for Emirates as the war kept other airlines out of the area; it was the only airline to continue flying in the last ten days of the war <stop>
 Following the conflicts <comma> a total of 92 air carriers were flying to markets internationally and Emirates faced intense competition at its home base <stop>
It carried about three million passengers a year to Dubai International Airport in the mid-1990s <stop>
Emirates continued to expand during the late 1990s <stop>
The growing cargo business accounted for 16 percent of the airline's total revenues <stop>
<stop>
Emirates started offering round-the-world services from autumn 1993 <comma> after a partnership was established with US Airways <stop>
 It previously had co-operation agreements with Cyprus Airways <stop>
 <stop>
By 1995 <comma> the airline expanded the fleet to six Airbus A300s and eight Airbus A310s and built the network up to cover 37 destinations in 30 countries <stop>
Then by 1996 <comma> the airline received its first Boeing 777–200 aircraft <comma> and these were followed shortly afterwards by six Boeing 777-200ERs <stop>
The arrival of the 777 allowed Emirates to continue its Singapore service onwards to Melbourne commencing in 1996 which would become a very profitable route for Emirates and would see more new destinations added in Australia <stop>
In 1998 Emirates Sky Cargo was launched <stop>
Although the Emirates had always provided a cargo service using capacity within its passenger aircraft this was now expanded with an aircraft <comma> crew <comma> maintenance and insurance lease agreed with Atlas Air initially for a single Boeing 747–200 freighter <stop>
 <stop>
In May 1998 <comma> Emirates paid the Government of Sri Lanka US$70 million for a 43 <stop>

 As part of the deal <comma> Emirates received a 10-year contract to manage SriLankan <stop>
 In January 2008 <comma> Emirates announced that it would end the management contract <comma> effective April 2008 <stop>
 Emirates subsequently sold its stake in the airline to the Government of Sri Lanka <comma> in an estimated US$150 million[24] deal that was finalised in 2010 <comma> thus ending any affiliation the two airlines had with each other <stop>
 On 9 November 2013 <comma> Emirates airline unveiled it first light sport aircraft to the world <stop>

<stop>
The growth of Emirates has drawn a lot of criticism from carriers like Lufthansa and Air Canada <comma> who claim Emirates has unfair advantages <stop>
Lufthansa has continuously lobbied the German government to limit the expansion of Emirates into Germany <comma> and hasn't allowed Emirates to begin operations to Berlin and Stuttgart since 2004 <stop>
 Similarly <comma> Air Canada has objected to any expansion into Canada from Emirates <stop>
The dispute has received attention from the governments of the UAE and Canada and despite many discussions from both governments <comma> Emirates has not been given more landing rights in Canada beyond Toronto <comma> and has been denied expansion to Calgary and Vancouver <stop>

 A third delay was announced on 3 October 2006 <comma> pushing the initial delivery of the first A380-800 to October 2007 <stop>
 The announcement was met with anger by Emirates' President Tim Clark <comma> who threatened to cancel their Airbus order as it was affecting the airline's expansion plan <comma> saying that "It's very serious <stop>
This will do us serious damage <stop>
"[54] In total as of April 2008 <comma> Airbus paid as much as $110 million during 2007 in compensation for the late delivery of the A380-800 to Emirates for the delays <stop>

 <stop>
<stop>
In 2010 <comma> Emirates said they planned to operate over 120 Airbus A380s when new airport space is available <stop>

The established network carriers in Europe and Australia <comma> i <stop>
e <stop>
Air France-KLM <comma> British Airways <comma> Lufthansa <comma> and Qantas <comma> perceive Emirates' strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it enables air travellers to by-pass traditional airline hubs such as London-Heathrow <comma> Paris-CDG <comma> and Frankfurt on their way between Europe/North America and Asia/Australia by changing flights in Dubai instead <stop>
These carriers also find it difficult to deal with the growing competitive threat Emirates poses to their business because of their much higher cost base <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
Some of these carriers <comma> notably Air France and Qantas <comma> have accused Emirates of receiving hidden state subsidies and of maintaining too cozy a relationship with Dubai's airport authority and its aviation authority <comma> both of which are also wholly state-owned entities that share the same government owner with the airline <stop>
Qantas' chairman claimed that Emirates is able to reduce its borrowing costs below market rates by taking advantage of its government shareholders' sovereign borrower status <stop>
 Emirates' president disagrees <comma> and has also referred to United States airlines bankruptcy protection as being a substantial form of state assistance <stop>
The airline makes regular profits <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
In May 2010 <comma> Emirates Airline executives refuted claims that the carrier does not pay taxes and receives substantial financial assistance from the Dubai government <stop>
They claimed that the airline received $80m in cash and kind since the start of the airline 25 years ago and this was substantially lower to what other national carriers have received <stop>
Maurice Flanagan also claimed that Emirates incurred social costs of around $600m in 2009 and this included municipal taxes to the city of Dubai <stop>
The airline also paid a dividend of AED956m ($260m) in 2010 <comma> compared to AED2 <stop>
9bn ($793m) in 2009 and each year the Government has received at least $100m in dividends <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
Emirates also faces competition from other UAE-based airlines <comma> Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi and the low-budget Air Arabia of Sharjah,[158] as well as Qatar Airways of Qatar <stop>
<stop>
Incidents <stop>
<stop>
On 9 April 2004 <comma> an Emirates Airbus A340-300 operating a flight from Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne before the end of the runway <comma> striking 25 approach lights <comma> causing four tires to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft <comma> ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism <stop>
This rendered the flaps immoveable in the takeoff position <stop>
The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage <stop>
The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 metres from the end of the 3,400 metre runway using reverse thrust and the alternate braking system <stop>
 In their report <comma> South African investigators found that the captain had used an erroneous take-off technique <comma> and criticised Emirates training and rostering practices <stop>
 <stop>
On 20 March 2009 <comma> Emirates Flight 407 <comma> an Airbus A340-500 (Registration A6-ERG) en route from Melbourne to Dubai failed to take off properly at Melbourne Airport <comma> hitting several structures at the end of the runway before eventually climbing enough to return to the airport for a safe landing <stop>
There were no injuries <comma> but the incident was severe enough to be classified as an accident by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau <stop>
<stop>
