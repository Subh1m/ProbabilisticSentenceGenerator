When measured by passengers carried it is second-largest in Britain <comma> behind easyJet <stop>
The airline is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport <stop>
<stop>
<stop>
A British Airways Board was established by the United Kingdom government in 1972 to manage the two nationalised airline corporations <comma> British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways <comma> and two smaller <comma> regional airlines <comma> Cambrian Airways <comma> from Cardiff <comma> and Northeast Airlines <comma> from Newcastle upon Tyne <stop>
On 31 March 1974 <comma> all four companies were merged to form British Airways <stop>
After almost 13 years as a state company <comma> British Airways was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the Conservative government <stop>
The carrier soon expanded with the acquisition of British Caledonian in 1987 <comma> followed by Dan-Air in 1992 and British Midland International in 2012 <stop>
<stop>
<stop>
British Airways is a founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance <comma> along with American Airlines <comma> Cathay Pacific <comma> Qantas <comma> and the now defunct Canadian Airlines <stop>
The alliance has since grown to become the third-largest <comma> after SkyTeam and Star Alliance <stop>
British Airways merged with Iberia on 21 January 2011 <comma> formally creating the International Airlines Group (IAG) <comma> the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe <stop>
IAG is listed on the London Stock Exchange and in the FTSE 100 Index <stop>

History <stop>
Main article: History of British Airways <stop>
A Boeing 747-100 in BOAC-British Airways transition livery <stop>
In January 1972 a British Airways Board was established by the UK government following the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1971 <comma> to manage British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) <stop>
On 1 September 1972 the management service functions of both BOAC and BEA were combined under the newly formed British Airways Group <stop>
<stop>
British Airways was established as an airline on 31 March 1974 by the dissolution of BOAC and BEA <stop>
 Following two years of fierce competition with British Caledonian <comma> the second-largest airline in Britain at the time <comma> the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes <stop>
 <stop>
British Airways and Air France operated the supersonic airliner Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde <comma> and the world's first supersonic passenger service flew in January 1976 from London Heathrow to Bahrain <stop>
 Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to Washington Dulles airport <comma> and flights to New York JFK airport followed on 22 September 1977 <stop>
Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with Singapore Airlines as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain <stop>
 Following the Air France Concorde crash in Paris and a slump in air travel following the 11 September attacks in New York in 2001 <comma> it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service <stop>
The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003 <stop>
 <stop>

In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the Conservative Thatcher government <stop>
Sir John King <comma> later Lord King <comma> was appointed chairman <comma> charged with bringing the airline back into profitability <stop>
While many other large airlines struggled <comma> King was credited with transforming British Airways into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world <stop>
 The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987 <stop>
 British Airways effected the takeover of Britain's "second" airline <comma> British Caledonian <comma> in July of that same year <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
The formation of Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984 created a competitor for BA <stop>
The intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated in the former being sued for libel in 1993 <comma> arising from claims and counter claims over a "dirty tricks" campaign against Virgin <stop>
This campaign included allegations of poaching Virgin Atlantic customers <comma> tampering with private files belonging to Virgin and undermining Virgin's reputation in the City <stop>
As a result of the case BA management apologised "unreservedly" <comma> and the company agreed to pay £110,000 damages to Virgin <comma> £500,000 to Branson personally and £3 million legal costs <stop>
 Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by his deputy <comma> Colin Marshall <comma> while Bob Ayling took over as CEO <stop>
 Virgin filed a separate action in the US that same year regarding BA's domination of the trans-Atlantic routes <comma> but it was thrown out in 1999 <stop>
 <stop>

<stop>
In 1992 British Airways expanded through the acquisition of the financially troubled Dan-Air <comma> giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick airport <stop>
British Asia Airways <comma> a subsidiary based in Taiwan <comma> was formed in March 1993 to operate between London and Taipei <stop>
That same month BA purchased a 25% stake in the Australian airline Qantas and <comma> with the acquisition of Brymon Airways in May <comma> formed British Airways Citiexpress (later BA Connect) <stop>
 In September 1998 <comma> British Airways <comma> along with American Airlines <comma> Cathay Pacific <comma> Qantas <comma> and Canadian Airlines <comma> formed the Oneworld airline alliance <stop>
Oneworld began operations on 1 February 1999 <comma> and is the third largest airline alliance in the world <comma> behind SkyTeam and Star Alliance <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
Bob Ayling's leadership led to a cost savings of £750m and the establishment of a budget airline <comma> Go <comma> in 1998 <stop>
 The next year <comma> however <comma> British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone <comma> its worst in seven years <stop>
 In March 2000 <comma> Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor <stop>
That year <comma> British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger <comma> reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission <stop>
 The plan fell through in September 2000 <stop>
 British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei <stop>
Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001 <stop>
 Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001,[8] and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004 <stop>
 In 2005 Willie Walsh <comma> managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot <comma> became the chief executive officer of British Airways <stop>
 BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008 <comma> taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States <stop>
OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports <stop>
 <stop>
British Airways and Iberia merged in January 2011 <comma> forming the International Airlines Group <comma> one of the world's largest airlines <stop>
<stop>
<stop>
On July 2008 British Airways announced a merger plan with Iberia <comma> another airline in the Oneworld alliance <comma> wherein each airline would retain its original brand <stop>
 The agreement was confirmed in April 2010,[23] and in July the European Commission and US Department of Transport permitted the merger and began to co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines <stop>
 On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways <comma> American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations <stop>
The alliance generates an estimated £230 million in annual cost-saving for BA <comma> in addition to the £330 million which would be saved by the merge with Iberia <stop>
 This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011 <comma> resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG) <comma> the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe <stop>
 Prior to merging <comma> British Airways owned a 13 <stop>
5% stake in Iberia <comma> and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia's other shareholders received the remaining 45% <stop>
 As a part of the merger <comma> British Airways ceased trading independently on the London Stock Exchange after 23 years as a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
In September 2010 Willie Walsh <comma> now CEO of IAG <comma> announced that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and had drawn up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions <stop>
 In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement in principle to purchase British Midland International from Lufthansa <stop>
 A contract to purchase the airline was agreed the next month,[33] and the sale was completed for £172 <stop>
5 million on 30 March 2012 <stop>
 The airline established a new subsidiary based at London City Airport operating Airbus A318s <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>

<stop>
<stop>
On the merger with Iberia <comma> the accounting reference date was changed from 31 March to 31 December; figures below are therefore for the years to 31 March up to 2010 <comma> for the nine months to 31 December 2010 <comma> and for the years to 31 December thereafter: <stop>
Staff working for British Airways are represented by a number of trade unions <comma> pilots are represented by British Air Line Pilots' Association <comma> cabin crew by British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (a branch of Unite the Union) <comma> while other branches of Unite the Union and the GMB Union represent other employees <stop>
Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009 <comma> although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident <stop>
 In an effort to increase interaction between management <comma> employees <comma> and the unions <comma> various conferences and workshops have taken place <comma> often with thousands in attendance <stop>
 <stop>
In 2005 <comma> wildcat action was taken by union members over a decision by Gate Gourmet not to renew the contracts of 670 workers and replace them with agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30 million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers <stop>
 In October 2006 <comma> BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross <comma> a religious symbol <stop>
 BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw <stop>
 <stop>
Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite <stop>
In 2007 <comma> cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management <stop>
The strike was called off at the last minute <comma> British Airways losing £80 million <stop>
 In December 2009 <comma> a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support,[79] action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal <stop>
Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March <comma> BA withdrew perks for strike participants <stop>
 Allegations were made by the Guardian newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions <comma> the story was later withdrawn <stop>
 A strike was announced for May 2010 <comma> British Airways again sought an injunction <stop>
Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action <stop>
 Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson <comma> a Unite co-leader <comma> was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter <stop>

Overview <stop>
G-XLEA <comma> British Airways' first Airbus A380 <comma> accompanied by the Red Arrows at 2013 Royal International Air Tattoo <stop>
<stop>
With the exception of the Boeing 707 and early Boeing 747 variants from BOAC <comma> British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974 <stop>
The airline introduced the Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 into the fleet in the 1980s <comma> followed by the Boeing 747-400 <comma> Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 in the 1990s <stop>
BA is now the largest operator of Boeing 747-400s <comma> with 57 in its fleet <stop>
 Prior to the introduction of the 787 <comma> when Boeing built an aircraft for British Airways <comma> it was allocated the customer code 36 <comma> which appeared in their aircraft designation as a suffix <comma> such as 737–436 <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
In 1991 <comma> British Airways placed its first order for 777-200 aircraft <comma> ordering another four for fleet expansion in 2007 at a cost of around US$800 million <stop>
 BA's first 777s were fitted with General Electric GE90 engines <comma> but BA switched to Rolls-Royce Trent 800s for subsequent aircraft <stop>
 A BA Boeing 777-200 became the fastest subsonic New York to London flight at 5 hours and 16 minutes in January 2015 due to strong winds <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
Later in 2007 <comma> BA announced their order of thirty-six new long-haul aircraft <comma> including twelve Airbus A380s and twenty-four Boeing 787 Dreamliners <stop>
 Rolls-Royce Trent engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s <stop>
The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet <comma> while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's Boeing 747-400s and will most likely be used to increase capacity on key routes from London Heathrow <stop>
<stop>
<stop>
On 1 August 2008 <comma> BA announced orders for six Boeing 777-300ERs and options for four more as an interim measure to cover for delays over the deliveries of their 787-8/9s <stop>
Of the six that have been ordered <comma> four will be leased and two will be fully acquired by British Airways <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
On 22 April 2013 <comma> IAG confirmed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to order 18 A350-1000 aircraft for British Airways <comma> with an option for a further 18 <stop>
The aircraft would replace some of the airline's fleet of Boeing 747-400s <stop>
 Options for 18 Boeing 787 aircraft <comma> part of the original contract signed in 2007 <comma> have been converted into firm orders for delivery between 2017 and 2021 <stop>
 <stop>
<stop>
On 26 June 2013 <comma> British Airways took delivery of its first 787s <stop>
The aircraft began operations to Toronto on 1 September 2013 <comma> and began service to Newark on 1 October 2013 <stop>
 BA's first A380 was delivered on 4 July 2013 <stop>
 It began regular services to Los Angeles on 24 September 2013 <comma> followed by Hong Kong on 22 October 2013 <stop>
 <stop>

In 1997 <comma> there was a controversial change from the use of the former British Airways branding (which incorporated stylised elements of the Union flag) to a new livery which was intended mainly to reflect the diversity of places served by the airline – so-called "World Images" <stop>
This involved a range of different designs appearing on tailfins and elsewhere <comma> although the bodies of all the planes would use the corporate colours consistently; the exception was the Concorde fleet <comma> which would have a new tailfin design based on a stylised <comma> fluttering Union flag <stop>
 What became known as the "ethnic images" included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy <comma> related to countries on the company's network of routes <stop>
This was reported to have caused problems with air traffic control: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane <comma> but they were now harder to visually identify <stop>
 Several people spoke out against the change <comma> including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher <stop>
 BA's traditional rival <comma> Virgin Atlantic <comma> took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan "Britain's national flagcarrier" <stop>
 In 1999 the CEO of British Airways <comma> Bob Ayling <comma> announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design originally intended to be used only on the Concorde <comma> based on the Union Flag <stop>
