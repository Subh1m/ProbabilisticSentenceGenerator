## ProbabilisticSentenceGenerator
*A fun code that generates sentences probabistically based on n-grams over a given corpus*

This was a hobby project I did one fine Sunday when I was bored.
This repository has just one code for now *sentgen_version1.py* which is a sentence generator. It uses only 2-grams and works fine, but doesn't generate sentences that make sense.

In the further versions, these additional features will be integrated to generate more human-like sentence generators. On doing that, the sentence generator may be used for dialogue systems or in question answering machines. This are the features which will be used to develop an efficient sentence generator.
- n-grams
- sliding window based sentence likelihood
- context based word likelihood
- markov chains
- numerical features to be extracted to train samples using Machine Learning
